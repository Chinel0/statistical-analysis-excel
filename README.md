# Statistical Analysis Fundamentals using Excel – Final Project

## Overview

This repository contains my final project for the "Statistical Analysis Fundamentals using Excel" course, a core module of the IBM BI Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. In this project, I analyzed supermarket sales transactions data spanning 2021 to 2023 to derive actionable business insights. The project involved:

- Calculating key descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, quartiles, and percentiles)
- Creating data visualizations such as histograms and pivot charts to illustrate revenue trends
- Performing multiple linear regression analysis to forecast future sales based on historical data

The analysis and visualizations were developed entirely in Excel Desktop, showcasing my proficiency in Excel for statistical analysis, data visualization, and forecasting.

## Learning Objectives

Through this course and project, I have developed the following skills:
- Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing data using measures of central tendency and dispersion.
- Data Visualization: Creating histograms, pivot charts, and other graphs to effectively communicate trends.
- Regression Analysis: Building and interpreting regression models, evaluating model assumptions, and forecasting future outcomes.
- Business Intelligence: Applying statistical techniques to real-world business data to support informed decision-making.
- Excel Expertise: Leveraging advanced Excel functions, Data Analysis ToolPak, and pivot tables for business analytics.

## Project Details

### Data Overview

The dataset includes supermarket sales transactions for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. Key fields in the data include:
- Transaction details (date, city, state/province, country)
- Product information (product family, product department, product category)
- Sales metrics (units sold, revenue)

### Analysis Conducted

1. Descriptive Statistics:
   - Calculated the mean, median, and mode of revenue for each year.
   - Assessed data variability using variance and standard deviation (focused on 2021).
   - Determined the minimum, maximum, quartiles, and multiple percentiles for revenue.

2. Data Visualization:
   - Developed a histogram to display the probability distribution of revenue over the period.
   - Created pivot tables and pivot charts to compare region-wise (country, city) and product-wise revenue performance.
   - Identified key trends and anomalies in the data.

3. Regression Analysis:
   - Performed multiple linear regression using Excel’s Data Analysis ToolPak to forecast 2023 sales revenue based on historical sales from 2021 and 2022.
   - Evaluated regression model performance using R-squared, Significance F, and p-values.
   - Interpreted the results to provide insights into the factors affecting sales revenue.

## Repository Structure

3. Learn from the Project: 
   Use the formulas, charts, and regression outputs as a reference for advanced Excel-based statistical analysis.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw sales data into actionable insights by applying descriptive statistics, data visualization, and regression analysis.
I am eager to leverage these skills to drive data-informed decision-making in a business intelligence role.

I welcome any feedback or questions regarding this project.
